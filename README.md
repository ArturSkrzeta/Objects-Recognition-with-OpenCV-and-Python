<h2>Objects Recognition with OpenCV and Python</h2>
<p>OpenCV allows to process images in the real time. Using trained model we can recognize defined in the model objects on any video.</p>
<h3>Demo</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Program uses a trained classifier that helps to indetify cars.</li>
  <li>Trained classifier is imported from XML file.</li>
  <li>It recognizes car on any video you specify in the program.</li>
  <li>The bigger rectangle the closer the car is.</li>
  <li>The faster rectangle is growig the distance is getting shorter.</li>

  <li>Gif lowers video quality. Video is cut for gif creation. Script works with any cars video.</li>
</ul>
